                <h1>BRAND REVIEW</h1>
                <P>Food Concepts aim to create great value for money brands, with propositions that customers love. We do this by understanding what our customers want and need and by ensuring that we deliver on their expectations.

                    Our Brands, namely, Chicken Republic, PieXpress and The Chop Box are all proudly homegrown Nigerian brands, designed to meet the taste preferences, aspirations and budgets of West African consumers.
                    
                    We make it our mission to provide excellent customer experiences, great tasting products and everyday affordable value meals, delivered via our clean, comfortable and convenient restaurant environments and our online channel.
                    
                    Food Concepts only use quality ingredients, provided by local vendors and suppliers who comply with our quality standards and we support job creation for many others via our various brand building programmes.
                    
                    Health, Safety and Consumer Protection are also of critical importance to Food Concepts, as evidenced by our ISO22000:2018 Certification in 2019, our recertification in 2020 and our latest ISO Certifications in 2021.</P>
                <H2>Chicken Republic</H2>
                <P>From our humble beginning in Lagos in 2004, until today, the Chicken Republic Brand story is one of many twists and turns. With this said, we have always remained true to our passion, and that is to share our food with people that LOVE our soulfully spiced chicken meals, flavoured with our unique blend of authentic West African herbs and spices.

                    We are presently trading in over 150 locations across Nigeria and Ghana, with plans to operate 430 restaurants by the end of 2024.
                    
                    We are a proudly home-grown brand and we choose to spread the LOVE to all our customers through our committed staff as we continue our quest to let everyone TASTE THE LOVE.
                    
                    Our “Taste the Love” philosophy encourages a passionate brand spirit as we set out to challenge the status quo by providing our customers with tasty, everyday affordable value meals from our clean, cool, ambient restaurants and our online delivery channel.
                    
                    We deliver value to our customers, staff and shareholders by ensuring a clear focus on three key performance indicators which include:
                    
                    People Development
                    Sales Growth & Profit Growth
                    Operational Excellence
                    Chicken Republic is a committed supporter of Nigerian production. Most of our products are sourced directly from local Nigerian suppliers.
                    
                    Our philosophy is “People Capability Always”. We pride ourselves on being an equal opportunity employer, with a strong focus on creating opportunities for women and young adults.
                    
                    As a Nigerian brand, facing challenges and overcoming obstacles is in our DNA. Our motto is, “happy, but never content”.
                    
                    This quest for excellence, together with our committed staff, local partnerships and loyal customers has led us to be the fastest-growing, chicken-focused, quick-service restaurant chain in the country today.</P>
                    <H2>PieXpress</H2>
                    <p>Our PieXpress Brand caters for mobile, transient consumers who desire convenient, quality food on-the-go, at a price that satisfies both their “belle” and their pocket.

                        It has always been clear that the Nigerian consumers love flavour profiles and food types that resonate within their day-to-day lifestyle. The nostalgia associated with pies and pastries makes this a fast-moving category that is profitable and well loved by all age groups.
                        
                        Since launching in 2019, PieXpress has proven to be a cost effective and profitable Brand that enhances our economies of scale via:
                        
                        Better utilisation of our existing and new real estate – having the PieXpress stores in the Chicken Republic car parks allow us to really “sweat our assets”.
                        Minimal risk, as the concept can be moved easily from one location to another if the market dynamics are not right or change.
                        Low set up costs.
                        Ability to own the “Freshly Baked” value proposition within the QSR space”.
                        We currently operate over 70 PieXpress stores, with plans to bring this number to 247 by the end of 2024. We have also built 5 new Pie Production facilities and increased our footprint into 4 new states.
                        
                        Last but not least, we are proud to announce that we have now introduced Renewable Energy Solutions for stand-alone stores.</p>
                        <h2>ChopBox</h2>
                        <p>It is no secret that to truly win in Africa is to win at the base of the pyramid. Every day, tens of millions of Nigerian consumers buy traditional meals from informal eateries around the country.

                            Moreover, every research study that we have undertaken shows strong customer demand for traditional Nigerian meals. However, we also know that these same consumers, regardless of their income or social status, are highly aspirational and have a strong propensity toward iconic, world-class brands.
                            
                            Our newest creation, The Chop Box, is Food Concepts’ response to meeting these demands head-on.
                            It is still early days and at present, we only have one store, which we are currently using to prototype and refine our menu mix and value proposition.
                            
                            As with PieXpress, The Chop Box enables us to enhance our economies of scale via:
                            
                            Better utilisation of our existing and new real estate – having the PieXpress stores in the Chicken Republic car parks allow us to really “sweat our assets”.
                            Minimal risk, as the concept can be moved easily from one location to another if the market dynamics are not right or change.
                            Low set up costs.
                            This brand is also well suited to the implementation of renewable energy solutions and will enable us to explore interesting micro franchising concepts aimed at creating employment opportunities and ecosystems of value for grassroots entrepreneurs.</p>
